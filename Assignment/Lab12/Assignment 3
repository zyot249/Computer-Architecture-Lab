#Laboratory Exercise 12, Assignment 3

* Explain: Cache size, block size, number of sets, write policy and replacement policy.
Cache size: the whole size of cache memory
Block size: the cache is divided into bunch of blocks with the same size
Number of sets: Cache size divides block size


* If a cache is large enough that all the code within a loop fits in the cache, how many cache misses will there be during the execution of the loop ? Is this good or bad?
If a cache is large enough, there will be no cache misses, but the speed would be decrease


* What should the code look like that would benefit the most from a large block size?
Larger blocks should reduce miss rate due to spatial locality. But in a fixed-sized cache, larger blocks => fewer of them and then increase miss rate and pollution.
