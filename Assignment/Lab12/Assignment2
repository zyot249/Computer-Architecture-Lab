#Laboratory Exercise 12, Assignment 2

* How is the full 32-bit address used in the cache memory?
A computer uses 32-bit byte addressing in a cache memory: 18 bits use for tag, 10 bits use for set and 4 bits use for offset

* What happens when there is a cache miss?
A cache misses when the cache memory is accessed and the referenced data item is not present in the cache, RAM is accessed to allocate data. 

* What happens when there is a cache hit?
That's when data is found in cache

* What is the block size?
A cache is divided into cache blocks (or cache lines) and the block size is the size of a cache block.

* What is the function of the tag? 
The tag is kept to allow the cache to translate from a cache address (tag, index, offset) to a unique CPU address
